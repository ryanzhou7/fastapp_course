    "question": "What does the `$ curl https://mise.run` do?",
    "answer": {
      "choices": [
        "It downloads the content of the URL and saves it to a file, then executes it",
        "It downloads the content of the URL and executes it",

  "Now let's look at the second command, `sh`. Run `$ sh` at the terminal, what does it do?",
  {
    "question": "What does the `$ sh` command do?",
    "answer": {

    "question": "How do we give the `$ sh` interpreter the code `echo 'Hi'` via all at once as a script?",
    "answer": {

      ],
      "correct_choice_index": 3,
      "explanation": "Though all of these work we want understand the `$ echo 'echo \"hi\"' | sh` the most. This is because it is a common pattern to pipe the output of one command to another command as `$ curl https://mise.run | sh` does. Why doesn't `$ echo 'hi' | sh` work? The error you get is `sh: 1: hi: not found`. This is because echo outputs 'hi', which is not a valid command. Hence, we need to double echo."
    }
  },
  "Now that we know `$ curl https://mise.run` downloads the content of the URL and outputs it, `|` passes the output to `$ sh`, which runs the commands. We see how `mise` is installed. Some code is given to the `sh` interpreter to run.",

  "`sh` `zsh`, `sh`, and `bash` are all shells / interpreters. Of the 3, `sh` is the oldest and called Bourne Shell. Bash is an improved version of `sh` which stands for Bourne Again SHell (capital letters spell out `bash`). On most servers, the default shell is `bash` even though `sh` is also available. It is unhelpful that a lot of the same code works in all these interpreters, like `echo 'hi'`, but not everything, so be wary of which shell is executing your code if you run into errors. `zsh` was chosen by apple to be the macOS default shell, which allows for rich customizations.",
  "Let's go piece by piece to understand the `$ echo 'eval \"$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)\"' >> ~/.zshrc` command. Starting with `$ eval`, an built-in shell command that takes a string as an argument and evaluates it as if it were a command",

      "explanation": "The `>>` operator appends the command `echo 'hi'` to the `.zshrc` file, so it will be executed every time a new terminal is opened. The dangerous command is `>`, which overwrites the file. You can test this out with a simple command like `$ echo 'v1' > test.txt` then `$ cat test.txt` to see the contents, then `$ echo 'v2 '> test.txt`. Does the file have both `v1` and `v2` or just `v2`?"
