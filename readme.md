# Introduction

## Conventions

- If there is a `$` then it means it is meant to be typed at the command line, for example `$ python --help`

- commenting in files

```python
# src/__init__.py <- means that the code contents below are from the __init__.py file in the src folder

print('Hello World')

# ... <- means that extra lines may occur between these 2 print statements but we omitted for brevity as it is not the focus

print('Hello World again!')
```

- Please start in numerical ascending, i.e. ch1, ch2, etc...
