# Introduction

## Conventions

- If there is a `$` then it means it is meant to be typed at the command line, for example `$ python --help`

```python
# src/__init__.py <- means that the code contents below are from the __init__.py file in the src folder
print('Hello World')
# ... <- means that extra lines may occur between these 2 print statements but
# we omit them for brevity / they are not the focus
print('Hello World again!')
```
